Update to the group:- 
Because we know that we are no longer in the site we were in Batima, we will have to find a new one 
So far, we have agreed and followed through with a roof size of 80 m^2
To ensure we are collecting as much water as possible, I would like to extend that roof size to at least 100 m^2
The team and I will see if this is possible to do in the area we have got (as in combine 2 different roofs)

FINALISED PROCESSES 
Rain Water collection system - finalised and selected, supplier on board with what we need
Will call, confirm and buy products once the imprest comes through

New Tasks especially for all members going on trip:-

Petros/Aakeen - re-visit ME1 pipes and also internet to find out all the things we need to consider when buying/installing pipes
so things like pressures, friction etc.
